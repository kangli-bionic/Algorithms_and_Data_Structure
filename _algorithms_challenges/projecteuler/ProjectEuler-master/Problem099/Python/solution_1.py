"""
Largest exponential
Problem 99

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not difficult,
as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 < 37 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382518061 > 519432525806
would be much more difficult, as both numbers
contain over three million digits.

Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent
pair on each line,
determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the
numbers in the example given above.
